# Raspberry-Pi-Email-Notifier
A raspberry pi powered email notifier. The SenseHat LED grid notifies you of how many unread emails you have.
Upon plugging in the raspberry pi, your number of unread emails scrolls across the LED grid, as well as an image of an evolope giving you a subtle idea of how many emails you may have. The images consist of an envolope with a green square on the top right corner; this image means you only have one unread email. If you have more than one unread email, a yellow box will appear on the top right corner. If you have a lot of unread emails, a red square shows up on the top right. If you have no unread emails, a smiley face displays on the screen.
